# landing-project_1

This is the actual landing page for The Odin Project. I did it the day after the initial Landing Project. With this one, I opened myself up to referencing websites and tutorials to help streamline the CSS. I practiced writing pseudocode with this one (albeit on a word doc I haven't uploaded) and learned to be more efficient.

I copied and pasted code from the first landing page that I felt worked and spent time looking at the code I didn't like to see how I could change it.

I inserted comments into the HTML and CSS files as I went this time to have a frame of reference for why I was making the choices I did. 


The biggest takeaway I had from doing the blind initial run and this was from exploring the parent-child relationship between DIVs, specifically in CSS. THe time spent aligning boxes was much faster after this. 

I really enjoyed this approach of a blind run followed by something more structured. It let my brain explore and satisfied some of the impulsiveness that comes with ADHD. Indeed, it squashed a lot of the frustration that comes with ADHD during high functioning exercises. I think I will do this approach more for free form explorative thought processes.
